Illustrated with most valuable notes and annotations, theological, critical, moral, divine, historical, geographical, systematical, biographical, practical, admonitory, chronological, and explanatory. Wherein all the difficult and obscure passages are clearly explained; the seeming contradictions in every respect reconciled; the mis-translations corrected; the errors of former commentators rectified and pointed out; the objections of deists and infidels answered; the prophecies and parables faithfully elucidated; sublime passages properly noted; the offices of the Jewish and Christian churches thoroughly investigated; every minute circumstance of the revealed will of God faithfully recorded; all proper names, together with scripture weights and measures, accompanied with the necessary interpretations and illustrations; and the whole of divine revelation (upon which all our hopes of eternal happiness depend) displayed in its original purity, and rendered easy, pleasant; and profitable to every capacity, both with respect to faith and practice. With practical reflections, improvements, and useful admonitions at the end of each chapter; and an illustration of the doctrines and duties contained in the various parts of the Holy Scriptures. Calculated to enlighten the understanding, purify the heart, and promote the cause of virtue and piety; and thereby establish the happiness and peace o[f] Christian families in this world, and secure their eternal salvation in the next. To which are added, as a farther elucidation of the whole, a complete connection of the old and new testaments; the lives of all the inspired writers, from Genesis to the Revelations; a critical account of the various translations of the Holy Bible; tables of scripture weights, measures, &c. and many other articles (too numerous to mention here) relating to Jewish and Christian antiquities, and other important subjects, not to be found in any other commentator, but which are essentially necessary to explain and illustrated the sacred writings. This valuable body of Christian Divinity, and treasury of divine revelation, being the result of more than forty years study and experience (and not a hasty production, undertaken to serve pecuniary purposes) is executed in a manner far superior to other publications of the sort, and will alone form a complete Universal Library of Divine Knowledge, antient and modern.
