Stock of - - - - - - - 110 : 00 : 00 The remaining Value is - - - - - - 100 : 00 : 00 A few Millions more or less in a Matter of this Magnitude, according to the present high Price of South-Sea Stock, seems to be very Inconsiderable; I will therefore suppose, That the Company, by encreasing their Capital only to 21 Millions, will be entirely out of Debt, and will be then Intitled to the 42 Millions due from the Publick. Is it not apparent, that this Capital of 21 Millions (exclusive of the Profits by Trade) is Worth only 42 Millions; and that every Share therein can be but of a proportionable Value; and so 100 l. Stock, Worth only 200 l. exclusive of the Profits by Trade. If, after the Midsummer-Moon is over, the present reigning Madness should happen to cease, and no new Purchasers should be found; but the present Proprietors of the South-Sea Stock left to please themselves, with the imaginary Value thereof, until the Debt due to them from the Publick should be repaid; Could it possibly be of any more intrinsick Worth than I have before supposed; and if not to them, Can it become more Valuable to any others, to whom they shall Transfer the same? I will readily agree, That if new Purchasers come in at high Prices, the Condition of the present Proprietors will be thereby mended; but whatever they Gain the others Lose. For whether the Stock be 21 Millions, Intitled to a Divident of 21 Millions more; or be 30 Millions, Intitled to a Dividend of 12 Millions more; or be compleated to 42 Millions, without any further Dividend in Stock; it is evident, that the whole Capital can be intrinsically Worth only 42 Millions, and no more, exclusive of the Profits on Trade. It is also evident, That whether the Company divide the remaining 21 Millions amongst their present Proprietors in Four, Fourteen, or any other Number of Years, it can be only of an equal Value to an immediate Dividend at once of the said remaining 21 Millions; and in that Case, 200 l. in such encreased Capital Stock would be Worth no more than 100 l. in the present Capital. Because such encreased Capital would be Intitled to no further Dividend in Stock; but the present Capital is Intitled to a Dividend of 21 Millions; viz. of Cent. per Cent. And there cannot, surely, be a greater Delusion; and yet it seems to prevail, that after several Dividends made in Stock, that the remaining Stock will still continue as Valuable as that which was before disposed of; or that 100 l. Stock in such encreased Capital is Worth as much as 100 l. in a lesser Capital; as if 100 l. Stock in the Capital of 21 Millions, Intitled to a Dividend of 21 Millions more, were not of a much greater Value than 100 l. Stock in a Capital of 30 Millions, Intitled only to a Dividend of 12 Millions; or in a Capital of 42 Millions, Intitled to no further Dividend in Stock. - It is not pretended, that the aforegoing Calculations are Exact; or that there are no Mistakes in the Inferences made therefrom; But People must be left to compute and reason as they are able, until the Directors of the South-Sea Company shall think fit to publish an exact State of this Matter; and thereby shew, the real and intrinsick Value of their Stock.
