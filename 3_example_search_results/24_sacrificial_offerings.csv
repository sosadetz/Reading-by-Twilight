In which the most difficult passages are rendered clear and familiar, the seeming contradictions reconciled, the mis-translations rectified, and important truths confirmed, so as to confute the insidel, dispel the mists of darkness, enlighten the ignorant, encourage the diffident, reclaim the vicious, reconcile the doubtful, lead the wavering into the paths of truth, and implant in the mind of every Christian that divine knowledge which is essentially necessary to salvation. Forming a complete treasury of divine revelation. To which is added, at the end of each book, a summary of the doctrines contained therein, being a full explanation of the various books in the old and new testaments. And, as a farther illustration, will be given a general index, or concordance, clearly pointing out every material transaction recorded in the sacred writings. A chronological index of transactions from Adam to the time of our blessed Saviour. A geographical index of places mentioned in the Holy Scriptures. A full explanation of the proper names in the scriptures, with their significations, &c. A brief account of the apostles and their successors, who propagated the Christian religion, by presiding over the Apostolic Churches of Antioch, Jerusalem, &c. The whole forming a complete body of Christian Divinity, explained and illustrated in such a manner, as to guide the reader through the paths of happiness in this world, and lead him to the mansions of eternal bliss in that which is to come. By the Rev. Thomas Bankes, of St. Mary Hall, Oxon; vicar of Dixton, in Monmouthshire; and morning and afternoon preacher at Hampstead. Embellished and enriched with upwards of three hundred and fifty engravings, illustrating the various transactions recorded in the sacred writings, from Genesis to the end of the revelations.","Bankes, Thomas",175,9,0,2,1,1,2,0,0,2,0,6,0,5,16,1,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,6,0,1,3,2,1,0,9,3,0,6,0,16,3,0,4,30,1,3,0,0,1,6,3,5,2,2,0,0,0,1,2,5,1787,1,1,"London : Printed for C.

Containing the whole of the sacred text of the Holy Bible, as contained in the Old and New Testaments, with the Apocrypha, at large. Illustrated with most valuable notes and annotations, theological, critical, moral, divine, historical, geographical, systematical, biographical, practical, admonitory, chronological, and explanatory. Wherein all the difficult and obscure passages are clearly explained; the seeming contradictions in every respect reconciled; the mis-translations corrected; the errors of former commentators rectified and pointed out; the objections of deists and infidels answered; the prophecies and parables faithfully elucidated; sublime passages properly noted; the offices of the Jewish and Christian churches thoroughly investigated; every minute circumstance of the revealed will of God faithfully recorded; all proper names, together with scripture weights and measures, accompanied with the necessary interpretations and illustrations; and the whole of divine revelation (upon which all our hopes of eternal happiness depend) displayed in its original purity, and rendered easy, pleasant; and profitable to every capacity, both with respect to faith and practice. With practical reflections, improvements, and useful admonitions at the end of each chapter; and an illustration of the doctrines and duties contained in the various parts of the Holy Scriptures. Calculated to enlighten the understanding, purify the heart, and promote the cause of virtue and piety; and thereby establish the happiness and peace o[f] Christian families in this world, and secure their eternal salvation in the next. To which are added, as a farther elucidation of the whole, a complete connection of the old and new testaments; the lives of all the inspired writers, from Genesis to the Revelations; a critical account of the various translations of the Holy Bible; tables of scripture weights, measures, &c. and many other articles (too numerous to mention here) relating to Jewish and Christian antiquities, and other important subjects, not to be found in any other commentator, but which are essentially necessary to explain and illustrated the sacred writings. This valuable body of Christian Divinity, and treasury of divine revelation, being the result of more than forty years study and experience (and not a hasty production, undertaken to serve pecuniary purposes) is executed in a manner far superior to other publications of the sort, and will alone form a complete Universal Library of Divine Knowledge, antient and modern. Being calculated on a plan entirely new, and containing, among the other great improvements never before attempted, every remark valuable or worthy of notice, in former works of this kind. By Paul Wright, D.D.-F.S.A. vicar of Oakley, and rector of Snoreham, in Essex, late of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, and author of other learned, pious, and useful works, universally approved of by Christians of every denomination. Dedicated to the Right Reverend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of London. Search the scriptures, for therein are contained the words of eternal life;-they have God for their author! salvation for their end! and truth, without any mixture of error, for their matter!

Illustrated with most valuable notes and annotations, theological, critical, moral, divine, historical, geographical, systematical, biographical, practical, admonitory, chronological, and explanatory. Wherein all the difficult and obscure passages are clearly explained; the seeming contradictions in every respect reconciled; the mis-translations corrected; the errors of former commentators rectified and pointed out; the objections of deists and infidels answered; the prophecies and parables faithfully elucidated; sublime passages properly noted; the offices of the Jewish and Christian churches thoroughly investigated; every minute circumstance of the revealed will of God faithfully recorded; all proper names, together with scripture weights and measures, accompanied with the necessary interpretations and illustrations; and the whole of divine revelation (upon which all our hopes of eternal happiness depend) displayed in its original purity, and rendered easy, pleasant; and profitable to every capacity, both with respect to faith and practice. With practical reflections, improvements, and useful admonitions at the end of each chapter; and an illustration of the doctrines and duties contained in the various parts of the Holy Scriptures. Calculated to enlighten the understanding, purify the heart, and promote the cause of virtue and piety; and thereby establish the happiness and peace o[f] Christian families in this world, and secure their eternal salvation in the next. To which are added, as a farther elucidation of the whole, a complete connection of the old and new testaments; the lives of all the inspired writers, from Genesis to the Revelations; a critical account of the various translations of the Holy Bible; tables of scripture weights, measures, &c. and many other articles (too numerous to mention here) relating to Jewish and Christian antiquities, and other important subjects, not to be found in any other commentator, but which are essentially necessary to explain and illustrated the sacred writings. This valuable body of Christian Divinity, and treasury of divine revelation, being the result of more than forty years study and experience (and not a hasty production, undertaken to serve pecuniary purposes) is executed in a manner far superior to other publications of the sort, and will alone form a complete Universal Library of Divine Knowledge, antient and modern. Being calculated on a plan entirely new, and containing, among the other great improvements never before attempted, every remark valuable or worthy of notice, in former works of this kind. By Paul Wright, D.D.-F.S.A. vicar of Oakley, and rector of Snoreham, in Essex, late of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, and author of other learned, pious, and useful works, universally approved of by Christians of every denomination.
