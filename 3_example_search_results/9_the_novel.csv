The Mysteries of the wisest and best Politics are here developed: the inordinate Passions are depicted as a Yoke equally disgraceful and fatal; while the Moral Duties appear with all the Attractions of Ease and Beauty. The reasoning is just, the precepts are important. It is a Work which Genius and Learning have dedicated to Virtue: it at once captivates the Imagination, informs the Understanding, and regulates the Will. This valuable Book teaches us to make Morality an Religion our Guide in good, as well as in adverse Fortune; never to forget the Love we owe our Paretnts and our Courntry. It forms our Minds for a king, a Citizen, a feather, a mother, a Master, a Gentleman, a Tradesman, a Servant, and even a Slave, if such should be our Lot; and, in short, teaches us to act properly in all the vaious Spheres of Life. Mentor (under which Character is meant Minerva) in his Counsels to Telemachus, must make us just, humane, patient, sincere, discret, and modest. He never speaks but he places, engages, moves and persuades. We cannot attend to him but with Admiration; and, in Proportion as we admire, we cannot help loving his Advice, which is entertaining as well as instructive.
