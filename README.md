**Reading-by-Twilight: Search and the Depths of the Archive**

DOI [ADD]

This repository contains a research appendix relating to the prototype semantic search engine for eighteenth-century texts.

**1. Query Details**

  a. Loading set of literary passage used to generate initial query cluster
  b. Primary query cluster

**2. Prototype Screenshots**

 Static images illustrating the primary components of the prototype search engine (query builder, results, filters)

**3. Example Search Results**

 Spreadsheets detailing basic statistics for >80 queries on various eighteenth-century topics. In all cases, simple term-frequency stats are provided, although the prototype provides alternatives (TFIDF, Elasticsearch score).

 NB: A very small snippet of text is given for each passage in the column `short_excerpts` at the end of the spreadhsheet. This can be used to locate passages in Gale's ECCO platform.
   Instructions:
     a. Locate correct volume using metdata (i.e. title, author, pub date, # pages)
     b. Search within that volume for an exact bigram from `short_excerpts`, the rarer the better.
    (I plan to post a short video illustrating this.)
 
**4. Platform Comparison - Experiment Details**

   Observations relating to the platform-comparison experiment described in section 5 of the article.
   a. 0. platform_comparison_-_query_details - General comments and query details
   b. Observations: Direct comparison of volumes retrieved by ECCO and HathiTrust and my own prototype, including number of passages matched in that volume and the rank of the first pasage matched.
   c. Prototype results: Benchmark spreadsheets with passage-level details, 1000 hits for each query.
   d. Screenshots of ECCO and HathiTrust volume results

**5. Additional Figures**

   More detailed (color) versions for certain figures that appear in the article.
