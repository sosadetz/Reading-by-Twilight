**Reading-by-Twilight: Search and the Depths of the Archive**

**1. Query Details**

  a. Loading set of literary passages used to generate initial query cluster
  
  b. Primary query cluster

**2. Prototype Screenshots**

 Static images of search engine (query builder, results, filters)

**3. Example Search Results**

 Spreadsheets detailing basic statistics for >80 queries on various eighteenth-century topics. In all cases, simple term-frequency stats are provided, although the prototype provides alternatives (TFIDF, Elasticsearch score).

 NB: A very small snippet of text is given for each passage in the column `short_excerpts` at the end of the spreadhsheet. This can be used to locate passages in Gale's ECCO platform.
   
   Instructions:
     
     a. Locate correct volume using metdata (i.e. title, author, pub date, # pages)
     
     b. Search within that volume for an exact bigram from `short_excerpts`, the rarer the better.
    
    (I plan to post a short video illustrating this.)
 
**4. Platform Comparison - Experiment Details**

   Observations relating to the platform-comparison experiment described in Section 5.
   
   a. `0. platform_comparison_-_query_details` - General comments
   
   b. Observations: Direct comparison of ECCO and HathiTrust volumes prototype, incl. # passages matched and the rank of first pasage matched.
   
   c. Prototype results: Benchmark passage-level spreadsheets, 1000 hits per query.
   
   d. Screenshots of ECCO and HathiTrust results

**5. Additional Figures**

   Detailed (color) versions for certain figures that appear in the article.
